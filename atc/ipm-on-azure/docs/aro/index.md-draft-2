# Azure Red Hat OpenShift for IBM Product Master
### [DRAFT]

_This document is functional, though still in active development and undergoing frequent changes._

_Revision: Wed 23 Sep 2020 08:59:26 PM EDT_
&nbsp;<br>

### Introduction
This document details the steps required to automate the build of a secure, private Azure Red Hat OpenShift v4.x (ARO) infrastructure for IBM Product Master v12.x.

The procedure to install IBM Product Master is an accompanying document.

#### Azure

Microsoft Azure is a comprehensive cloud computing service managed by Microsoft. It provides software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS).

#### OpenShift Container Platform

Red Hat's OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) is a hybrid cloud, enterprise Kubernetes application platform.  It is a platform as a service (Paas) built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), with Docker containers managed by Kubernetes.

#### Azure Red Hat OpenShift

Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) is a fully managed offering of Red Hat OpenShift running in Microsoft Azure. This service is jointly managed and supported by both Microsoft and Red Hat.  For more details, see the Azure Red Hat OpenShift Service documentation.

#### IBM Product Master

IBM Product Master (IPM) provides trusted Product Information Management (PIM) and collaborative Master Data Management (MDM) capabilities. It creates an accurate and up-to-date repository of product and service information that can be used throughout organizations for strategic business initiatives

### Usage
This document provides a step-by-step approach.

**_Each step is dependent upon the successful completion of previous steps._**

The steps are structured and all follow this same pattern.

###### _Description_

* Many steps will have a detailed description that will provide additional context.  In the interest of brevity, not all steps will have detailed descriptions.


###### _Reference(s)_

* Most steps will have relevant, linked references.  All references given are to supporting documentation.


###### _Command(s)_

* These are the bash commands that must be run.  The expectation is that they will be copy/paste.  For that reason, the majority of commands rely on pre-set environment variables.  The environment variables provide for portability, flexibility, and a consistent experience.  If there are problems running any commands then it's most likely the environment variables are incorrect.


###### _Example Output_

* When there is output from a command, the example output will be given.  Please compare the outputs to ensure consistency.  It may be helpful.

### 1 - Azure Tenant

A tenant is Microsoft's representation of an organization.  It is a dedicated instance of Azure Active Directory (AAD) that is received when creating a new relationship with Microsoft, like signing up for Azure, Microsoft Intune, or Microsoft 365.

Before Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) can be installed, Microsoft accounts must exist and have appropriate access to an AAD tenant with an AAD Premium P1 License or better.  A Global Administrator must be involved in the project.

If you are the Global Administrator of an existing tenant, go to step 2.

* [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant)


#### 1.1 - Create Microsoft Account

* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_account](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_account)


#### 1.2 - Create Global Administrator


The person who signed up for Microsoft online services automatically becomes the first Global Administrator.

Only global administrators can:

* Add and manage domains
* Assign the Global Administrator role to other users
* Reset passwords for all users


**_Reference(s):_**

#### 1.3 - Verify Admin Center Access


The Microsoft 365 admin center simplifies management of Microsoft 365 services. The admin center provides a tailored experience based on the the role of the logged in user.  It is the common entry point for all administrators.

#### 1.4 - Verify AAD License


The Azure Active Directory license can be verified by visiting the Directory Overview section on the Azure Portal.

### 2 - Azure Subscription

An Azure subscription is a trust relationship with Azure Active Directory. A subscription trusts AAD to authenticate users, services, and devices.

Azure subscriptions help organize access to Azure resources. They also help control how resource usage is reported, billed, and paid for. Each subscription can have a different billing and payment method.  Every Azure service belongs to a subscription, and the subscription ID is required during the installation of ARO.

There are multiple choices when configuring Azure subscriptions.  A tenant may have multiple Azure subscriptions that are paid via different payment methods.  Here we will focus on a single tenant with a single subscription.

A Global Administrator should do the following steps, become the Subscription Owner, and then assign the appropriate subscription roles to the OpenShift Administrators.

#### 2.1 - Create Azure Subscription


An Azure subscription may be purchased directly from Microsoft through the Azure website, through a Microsoft representative, or as part of a managed service from a Microsoft Partner.

The Microsoft account that purchases the Azure subscription will automtically be assigned the Owner role.  Additional Owners may be added later.

### 4 - Environment Variables

**_This step is most important._**

This document depends very much on the bash shell.

There are required bash environment variables that are necessary to execute most steps in this document.

The environment variables must be exported.

_Subsequent steps in this document will **not** work unless the bash shell environment is properly setup._



**_Reference(s):_**

* [https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Environment.html](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Environment.html)


#### 4.1 - Unset Environment Variables


Unsetting the ARO environment variables can help prevent issues when, or if they have changed.


**_Reference(s):_**

* [https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Environment.html](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Environment.html)


**_Command(s):_**

```bash
for ARO in $(env | grep ^ARO | awk -F= "{print \$1}" | sort -V); do echo unset $ARO; unset $ARO; done
```

**_Example Output:_**

```
unset ARO
unset ARO_ADMINISTRATORS_GROUP_NAME
unset ARO_APPLICATION_NAME
unset ARO_CLUSTER_NAME
unset ARO_DOMAIN_NAME
unset ARO_LOCATION_NAME
unset ARO_REDHAT_PULL_SECRET_DIR

unset ARO_VM_JUMP_SIZE
unset ARO_VNET_CIDR
unset ARO_VNET_NAME
```

#### 4.2 - Set Environment Variables


The following bash shell environment variables are required.  They are reused for multiple steps.

It is recommended that the environment variables be maintained in a configuration file, i.e. **_ipm.env_**

Maintaining a configuration file will make them easier to use and update.

_These are example values that must be changed for this installation._

**_Before proceeding, please take your time ensuring the environment variable values are correct._**


**_Reference(s):_**

* [https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Environment.html](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Environment.html)


**_Command(s):_**

```bash
cat "ipm.env" && source "ipm.env"
```

**_Example Output:_**

```
# NOTE:
#
# These variables may be set statically or dynamically.
#
# This example shows both, static and dynamic variables.
# For the dynamic variables, the order of variables is important
# because many values rely on the value of another variable.
#
# Please check, and double check the values.
#
# Each of these are required.

#### 6.2 - Subscription Owner Login


The Azure Subscription Owner must perform the remaining steps in this documentation.


**_Reference(s):_**

* [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)


**_Command(s):_**

```bash
az login
export AZ_USER=$(az account show --query 'user.name' --output tsv)
az role assignment list --role Owner --query "[?principalName=='${AZ_USER}'].principalName" --output tsv
```

**_Example Output:_**

```bash
joseph.tingiris@mitaei.net
```

#### 6.3 - Verify Azure Tenant


One way to verify the Azure Tenant is to obtain the Tenant ID with az.  Another way is to login to the Azure AAD portal.

The Tenant ID must match what is in the environment configuration file.


**_Reference(s):_**

* [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/account?view=azure-cli-latest#az_account_show](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/account?view=azure-cli-latest#az_account_show)
* [https://aad.portal.azure.com/](https://aad.portal.azure.com/)


**_Command(s):_**

```bash
az account show --query '[{tenantId:tenantId}, {homeTenantId:homeTenantId}]'
export AZ_TENANT_ID=$(az account show --query 'tenantId' --output tsv 2> /dev/null)
if [ "${ARO_TENANT_ID}" != "${AZ_TENANT_ID}" ];then; echo "ERROR! ARO_TENANT_ID (${ARO_TENANT_ID}) does not match this tenant id (${AZ_TENANT_ID})"; fi
```

**_Example Output:_**

```json
[
  {
    "tenantId": "25fe96e7-85ec-4e6a-b93f-779b16ff751d"
  },
  {
    "homeTenantId": "25fe96e7-85ec-4e6a-b93f-779b16ff751d"
  }
]
```

#### 6.4 - Set Default Subscription


Set the default subscription that the ARO resources will be installed in.


**_Reference(s):_**

* [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/account?view=azure-cli-latest#az_account_set](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/account?view=azure-cli-latest#az_account_set)


**_Command(s):_**

```bash
az account set -s "${ARO_SUBSCRIPTION_NAME}"
```

**_Example Output:_**

```diff
+ success does not produce any output
```

#### 6.5 - Verify Default Subscription


The Azure CLI Default Subscription will be used to provision all ARO resources.


**_Reference(s):_**

* [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/account?view=azure-cli-latest#az_account_list](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/account?view=azure-cli-latest#az_account_list)


**_Command(s):_**

```bash

```
### 7 - Subscription Owners

There should be at least two (2) Subscription Owners.  This step is optional, but recommended.  It will use the ${ARO_SUBSCRIPTION_OWNERS} environment value and ensure all User Principal Names (UPNs) are added as Subscription Owners.


**_Reference(s):_**

**_Command(s):_**

```bash
az account show --subscription "${ARO_SUBSCRIPTION_ID}" --query "[{subscription_name:name},{subscription_id:id}]"
export AZ_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$(az account show --query 'id' --output tsv 2> /dev/null)
if [ "${AZ_SUBSCRIPTION_ID}" != "${ARO_SUBSCRIPTION_ID}" ]; then echo "ERROR! az subscription name \"${AZ_SUBSCRIPTION_ID}\" does not match aro subscription name \"${ARO_SUBSCRIPTION_ID}\""; fi
```

**_Example Output:_**

  }
]
```

#### 8.3 - Verify Subscription Location


Verify the following configuration variables are valid:

* ${ARO_LOCATION_NAME}

_NOTE: Azure Red Hat OpenShift is only available in certain Microsoft geographies, or locations.  Please use the links in the references of this section to determine the most suitable location for the installation.  The location name will be used throughout this document._



**_Reference(s):_**

* [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/?products=openshift](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/?products=openshift)


**_Command(s):_**

```bash
az account list-locations --query "[?name=='${ARO_LOCATION_NAME}']" --output table
export AZ_LOCATION_NAME=$(az account list-locations --query "[?name=='${ARO_LOCATION_NAME}'].name" --output tsv)
if [ "${AZ_LOCATION_NAME}" != "${ARO_LOCATION_NAME}" ]; then echo "ERROR! az location name \"${AZ_LOCATION_NAME}\" does not match aro location name \"${ARO_LOCATION_NAME}\""; fi
```

**_Example Output:_**

```
Name    DisplayName    RegionalDisplayName
------  -------------  ---------------------
eastus  East US        (US) East US
```


#### 8.4 - Verify Subscription Limits


Verify the following configuration variable is not empty:

* ${ARO_VERIFY_QUOTA_NAMES}

An ARO cluster uses several Microsoft Azure components.  It requires a minimum of 40 Total Regional vCPUs and 36 Standard DSv3 Family vCPUs.

**_The Azure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints may be insufficient to install ARO._**

Default limits vary by offer category types, such as Free Trial and Pay-As-You-Go, and by series, such as Dv2, F, and G. For example, the default for Enterprise Agreement subscriptions is 350 cores.

It is wise to check the limits for the subscription type and if necessary, increase quota limits before the installation of an Azure OpenShift cluster.

ARO minimum limits are required for:

* Standard DSv3 Family vCPUs
* Standard Dv2 Family vCPUs

**_Reference(s):_**

* [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-subscription-service-limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-subscription-service-limits)
* [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-name-rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-name-rules)

**_Command(s):_**

```bash
if [ "${ARO_VERIFY_QUOTA_NAMES}" == "" ]; then echo "WARNING! ARO_VERIFY_QUOTA_NAMES is not set"; fi
```

**_Example Output:_**

```diff
+ success does not produce any output
```

#### 8.5 - Verify Subscription Quotas


**_This step must be done manually._**

Requesting a quota increase can take 24-48 hours to complete.  The Subscription Owner must do this step.

Ensure the quota increase requests a minimum of 50 for the following VM families, 100 is preferred.

Dv2 Series
DSv3 Series

To increase the quota limits, a support case must be opened. Microsoft will communicate directly to the person who requested the increase.  An increase in the VM series quotas automatically increases the total regional vCPU limit by the same amount.

_Links to Microsoft's directions on how to request a quota increase for a specific subscription are provided in the references section of this topic._

Verify subscription quotas for:

* Standard DSv3 Family vCPUs
* Standard Dv2 Family vCPUs

**_Reference(s):_**

* [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/supportability/per-vm-quota-requests](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/supportability/per-vm-quota-requests)
* [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/supportability/regional-quota-requests](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/supportability/regional-quota-requests)


#### 8.6 - Standard DSv3 Family vCPUs


Ensure the quota "limit" is greater than 50.


**_Command(s):_**

```bash
az vm list-usage --location ${ARO_LOCATION_NAME} --query "[?localName=='Standard DSv3 Family vCPUs']"
export AZ_VERIFY_QUOTA_LIMIT=$(az vm list-usage --location ${ARO_LOCATION_NAME} --query "[?localName=='Standard DSv3 Family vCPUs'].limit" --output tsv)
if [ "${AZ_VERIFY_QUOTA_LIMIT}" == "" ] || [ ${AZ_VERIFY_QUOTA_LIMIT} -lt 50  ]; then echo "ERROR! Quota limit for "Standard DSv3 Family vCPUs" is too low!  Open a support case with Microsoft."; fi
```

**_Example Output:_**

```
[
  {
    "currentValue": "0",
    "limit": "100",
    "localName": "Standard DSv3 Family vCPUs",
    "name": {
      "localizedValue": "Standard DSv3 Family vCPUs",
      "value": "standardDSv3Family"
    }
  }
]
```

#### 8.7 - Standard Dv2 Family vCPUs


Ensure the quota "limit" is greater than 50.


**_Command(s):_**

```bash
az vm list-usage --location ${ARO_LOCATION_NAME} --query "[?localName=='Standard Dv2 Family vCPUs']"
export AZ_VERIFY_QUOTA_LIMIT=$(az vm list-usage --location ${ARO_LOCATION_NAME} --query "[?localName=='Standard Dv2 Family vCPUs'].limit" --output tsv)
if [ "${AZ_VERIFY_QUOTA_LIMIT}" == "" ] || [ ${AZ_VERIFY_QUOTA_LIMIT} -lt 50  ]; then echo "ERROR! Quota limit for "Standard Dv2 Family vCPUs" is too low!  Open a support case with Microsoft."; fi
```

**_Example Output:_**

```

      "value": "standardDv2Family"
    }
  }
]
```
### 9 - OpenShift Administrators

Identify the people who will be responsible for administering the OpenShift cluster.  These individuals will need Microsoft accounts and elevated roles and responsibilities.

The details for how to use `az` to create users, groups, and add the necessary subscription roles is described below.


**_Command(s):_**

```bash
env | egrep -e '^ARO_DOMAIN_NAME'
echo "ARO_ADMINISTRATORS=${ARO_ADMINISTRATORS[@]}"
```

### 11 - Resource Group

An Azure resource group is a logical group in which Azure resources are deployed and managed.

To create ARO resources, a resource group location must be specified. This is where the physical datacenter is located, where resource group metadata is stored, and where the Azure resources are hosted.


**_Reference(s):_**

### 12 - Virtual Network

An Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is the fundamental building block for private networks in Azure. VNet enables many types of Azure resources, such as Azure Virtual Machines (VM), to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks. VNet is similar to a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, but brings with it additional benefits of Azure's infrastructure such as scale, availability, and isolation.

### 13 - OpenShift Subnets

Azure Red Hat OpenShift clusters require a virtual network with two empty subnets, for the master and worker nodes.   The networks must be in the same resource group.  The network numbers should be IPv4 RFC1918 compliant and prefixed.

Additional subnets are needed for related virtual machines and a VPN.  The VPN subnet must be named GatewaySubnet.

It is suggested the virtual network (VNet) prefix be /21 and each (master and worker) vnet subnet prefix be /23, which will allow for a total of 510 master nodes and 510 worker nodes.

_NOTE: In 2018, Microsoft started automatically enabling Network Watcher when a new vnet is created.  There is not strictly required for ARO and there is an additional cost associated.  This will be seen as a new resource group named NetworkWatcherRG and a new vnet named NetworkWatercher_<region>; Please see the references in this section for more details._

### 14 - Network Security Groups

An Azure Network Security Group (NSG) filters network traffic to and from Azure resources in an Azure virtual network. An NSG contains security rules that allow/deny network traffic to/from several types of Azure resources.

_NOTE:_

* _The Network Security Groups for the Master & Worker subnets will be automatically created when ARO is setup._
* _The Network Security Group for the GatewaySubnet will be created when the VPN Gateway is setup._


**_Reference(s):_**

### 15 - Network Security Group Rules

Network Security Group (NSG) Rules are evaluated by priority using the 5-tuple information (source, source port, destination, destination port, and protocol) to allow or deny the traffic. A flow record is created for existing connections. Communication is allowed or denied based on the connection state of the flow record. The flow record allows an NSG to be stateful.

### 16 - Related Subnets

IBM Product Manager requires related subnets for supplementary virtual machines, to host applications such as DB2.  These subnets should be within the same resource group and VNet range previously defined.  The network numbers should be IPv4 RFC1918 compliant and prefixed.

Using a virtual network (VNet) prefix /21, with the OpenShift master & worker subnet prefixed /23, then that will leave an additional four (4) /24 prefixes, or eight (8) /25 prefixes available.

This document will use /25 prefixes for the related subnets, e.g.

* 10.11.4.0/25 - Application Gateway Subnet
* 10.11.4.128/25 - Database Subnet
* 10.11.5.0/25 - DMZ Subnet
* 10.11.5.128/25 - Trusted Subnet
* 10.11.6.0/25 - VPN Gateway Subnet (GatewaySubnet)

### 17 - Jump Server Virtual Machine

A jump server, jump host, or jump box is a system on a network used to access and manage devices in a separate security zone. A jump server is a hardened and monitored device that spans two dissimilar security zones and provides a controlled means of access between them. The most common example of a jump server is a host in a DMZ.

All hosts within the DMZ may be prevented from connecting to the internal network by the Network Security Group (firewall) that separates them, unless the Network Security Group (firewall) permits the connection.

In the following steps, the jump server (jumpbox) will be put on the DMZ subnet, with tcp port 22 opened from the Internet. It will be allowed to communicate with the other internal subnets.  The NSGs may be further tune to allow specific access, as it will be done for the ARO master subnet when ARO is installed.

The jumpbox should be created prior to the VPN Gateway, so that there is at least one machine available for connectivity testing from two different security zones: Public (Internet) and Private (RFC1918).

#### 17.4 - Verify Jump Server Virtual NIC


A network interface enables an Azure Virtual Machine to communicate with internet, Azure, and on-premises resources.

```bash
az network nic show --resource-group ${ARO_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME} --name ${ARO_VM_JUMP_NAME}-nic --output table
```

**_Example Output:_**

```bash

```

#### 17.5 - Create Jump Server Availability Set


Availability sets help spread VMs across fault domains and update domains. It's best practice to use availability sets to make it easier to expand in the future.

Fault domains define a grouping of virtual machines that share a common power source and network switch. By default, the virtual machines that are configured within the availability set are separated across up to three fault domains. A hardware issue in one of these fault domains does not affect the VM.

Update domains indicate groups of virtual machines and underlying physical hardware that can be rebooted at the same time. During planned maintenance, the order in which update domains are rebooted might not be sequential, but only one update domain is rebooted at a time.

Azure automatically distributes VMs across the fault and update domains when placing them in an availability set. For more information, see managing the availability of VMs.

#### 17.7 - Accept Jump Server Image Terms


Some VM images in the Azure Marketplace have additional license and purchase terms that you must accept before you can deploy them programmatically.

To deploy a VM from such an image, you'll need to both accept the image's terms and enable programmatic deployment. You'll only need to do this once per subscription. Afterward, each time you deploy a VM programmatically from the image you'll also need to specify purchase plan parameters.

For Azure Marketplace images, the terms must be accepted.

We chose a free marketplace image for this documentation, so the image terms must be accepted.

The image URN is:

* cognosys:docker-ce-with-centos-8-0-free:docker-ce-with-centos-8-0-free:1.2019.0710

#### 17.9 - Create Jump Server Virtual Machine


An Azure Virtual Machines (VM) is one of several types of on-demand, scalable computing resources that Azure offers.  An Azure VM gives you the flexibility of virtualization without having to buy and maintain the physical hardware that runs it. However, you still need to maintain the VM by performing tasks, such as configuring, patching, and installing the software that runs on it.

### 18 - VPN Gateway

A VPN gateway is a specific type of virtual network gateway that is used to send encrypted traffic between an Azure virtual network and a remote location, over the public Internet.

This document will focus on creating the newer, Resrouce Manager deployment model with Azure certificate authentication.

#### 18.3 - Create VPN Gateway Public IP Address


The VPN Gateway requires a Public IP Address.

Zone-redundant VPN gateways and zonal gateways both rely on the Azure public IP resource Standard SKU. The configuration of the Azure public IP resource determines whether the gateway that you deploy is zone-redundant, or zonal. If you create a public IP resource with a Basic SKU, the gateway will not have any zone redundancy, and the gateway resources will be regional.

#### 18.5 - Create VPN Gateway


There are two types of Azure VPN Gateways, the Classic and Resource Manager deployment models.

Each virtual network can have only one VPN gateway.

Creating a virtual network gateway can take up to 45 minutes to complete.

### 19 - VPN Gateway Authentication

When using the native VPN Gateway Azure Certificate Authentication, a client certificate is used to authenticate the connecting user. Client certificates are generated from a trusted Root Certificate and then installed on each client computer.

The validation of the Client Certificate is performed by the VPN Gateway and happens during establishment of the point-to-site (P2S) VPN connection.

#### 19.5 - Verify VPN Gateway Root Certificate Moduli


This step verifies the modulus for the root certificate and key match.

Mismatched moduli will prevent a successful connection to the VPN Gateway.

*If the md5sums are different, then do not proceed.*

```

**_Example Output:_**

```

```

#### 19.6 - Create VPN Gateway Root Certificate Data


In a previous step, the root certificate was created in the Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) format.

PEM is the most common format for X.509 certificates. A PEM file is a text file containing one or more items in base64 ASCII encoding identified by plain-text headers and footers (i.e. -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- and -----END CERTIFICATE-----).

The VPN Gateway requires the public Root Certificate Data to be uploaded as the base64 ASCII encoding of the Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) format.

DER is a binary encoding for X.509 certificates and private keys. Unlike PEM, DER-encoded files do not contain plain text statements such as -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----.  DER is a binary format for data structures described by ASN.1.

**_Example Output:_**

```
found ipm-vpn root certificate name = ipm-vpn-root.crt
verified ipm-vpn-root.crt exists as a root certificate name for ipm-vpn
```

### 20 - VPN Client Certificates

VPN Clients must present an X.509 version 3 certificate when connecting. Each user should have their own bundle of certificate files.

This step outlines a procedure to create them with OpenSSL v1.1.1.  It will need to be re-run for everyone who requires connectivity.

The Azure VPN Gateway supports both IKEv2 (ipsec) and OpenVPN (ssl) client connections.  Various VPN client software support these technologies.  It is most convenient to distribute a PKCS#12 file to the user, so they can connect to the VPN Gateway and access the private Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster.

In cryptography, PKCS #12 defines an archive file format for storing many cryptography objects as a single file.  PKCS#12 evolved from Microsoft's Personal Information Exchange (PFX) standard and is used to exchange public and private objects.  It is commonly used to bundle a private key with its X.509 certificate or to bundle all the members of a chain of trust.

The terms PKCS #12 (pkcs12) and PFX (pfx) are often used interchangeably.

_Successful execution of the commands in this step depends upon the previously created VPN Gateway Root Certificate files and exported environment variables._

At minimum, these environment variables must be properly set beforehand:

* ARO_VGW_NAME
* ARO_VGW_PKI_BITS
* ARO_VGW_PKI_DIR
* ARO_VGW_PKI_ROOT_KEY_FILE
* ARO_VGW_PKI_ROOT_KEY_FILE_PASSPHRASE

Successful completion of the following steps will produce six (6) files, in this order:

* VPN Client Key (.key)
* VPN Client Certificate Request (.req)
* VPN Client Certificate Extensions (.ext)
* VPN Client Certificate (.crt)
* VPN Client Certificate Serial (.serial)
* VPN Client Certificate Bundle (.pfx)

The resulting PFX file is should be given to the user.

#### 20.1 - Export VPN Client ARO Environment Variables


These environment variables should be exported each time a new set of client certificate files are created.

_These are example values that must be changed for your installation._

#### 20.7 - Create VPN Client Certificate Extensions


A Root Certificate Authority (CA) uses extensions to issue a certificate only for a specific purpose.  Certificate Extensions were introduced in X.509 version 3 (X509v3).

The Azure VPN Gateway requires specific Certificate Extensions on VPN Client certificates.  More specificially, a VPN Client certificate must have the _TLS Web Client Authentication_ (clientAuth) extended key usage (eku) extension.  Additionally, _X509v3 Subject Alternative Name_ (subjectAltName) must always be used per RFC 5280.

This step creates a certificate extension file that OpenSSL will read when creating the certificate, and apply the proper extensions.

#### 20.11 - Verify VPN Client Certificate Moduli


This step verifies the modulus for the client certificate, request, and key match.

Mismatched moduli will prevent a successful connection to the VPN Gateway.

*If the md5sums are different, then do not proceed.*

```

#### 21.3 - Distribute VPN Client PFX & URL


It is necessary for anyone connecting to the VPN Gateway to have a:

* VPN Client Configuration (zip)
* VPN Client Key (key)
* VPN Client Certificate (crt)

The VPN Client Key and Certificate may be distributed separately, or as the single PFX file.

### 22 - Obtain Pull Secrets

Pull secrets are required when referencing images across OpenShift Container Platform projects or from secured registries.


#### 22.1 - Obtain Red Hat Pull Secret


**_This step must be done manually._**  It is optional though recommended.

A Red Hat pull secret enables access to Red Hat container registries that contain additional OpenShift content.

To obtain a Red Hat pull secret, go to the Red Hat OpenShift cluster manager portal:

* [https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/azure/aro-provisioned](https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/azure/aro-provisioned)


**_Reference(s):_**

* [https://access.redhat.com/solutions/4844461](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/4844461)


#### 22.2 - Verify Red Hat Pull Secret


**_Command(s):_**

```bash
ls -ld "${ARO_REDHAT_PULL_SECRET_FILE}"
```

**_Example Output:_**

```bash
-rw-rw----. 1 jtingiris mit 2835 Sep 12 10:26 /home/jtingiris/prj/mit/aei/secrets/ipm-redhat-pull-secret.txt
```

### 23 - Azure Red Hat OpenShift

* [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/aro?view=azure-cli-latest](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/aro?view=azure-cli-latest)


**_Command(s):_**

```bash
env | egrep -e 'ARO_CLUSTER_NAME|ARO_REDHAT_PULL_SECRET_FILE|ARO_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME|ARO_VNET_NAME|ARO_SUBNET_MASTER_NAME|ARO_SUBNET_WORKER_NAME' | sort -V
```

**_Example Output:_**

```bash
ARO_CLUSTER_NAME=ipm-cluster
ARO_REDHAT_PULL_SECRET_FILE=/home/jtingiris/prj/mit/aei/secrets/ipm-redhat-pull-secret.txt
ARO_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME=ipm-eastus
ARO_SUBNET_MASTER_NAME=ipm-vnet-master-subnet
ARO_SUBNET_WORKER_NAME=ipm-vnet-worker-subnet
ARO_VNET_NAME=ipm-vnet
```

#### 23.1 - Create ARO Cluster


This can take up to an hour.


**_Reference(s):_**

* [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/aro?view=azure-cli-latest#az_aro_create](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/aro?view=azure-cli-latest#az_aro_create)


**_Command(s):_**

```bash
az aro create --resource-group ${ARO_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME} --name ${ARO_CLUSTER_NAME} --vnet ${ARO_VNET_NAME} --master-subnet ${ARO_SUBNET_MASTER_NAME} --worker-subnet ${ARO_SUBNET_WORKER_NAME} --apiserver-visibility Private --ingress-visibility Private --pull-secret @${ARO_REDHAT_PULL_SECRET_FILE} --no-wait
```

**_Example Output:_**

```diff
+ success does not produce any output
```

#### 23.2 - Verify ARO Cluster


**_Command(s):_**

```bash
az aro show --name ${ARO_CLUSTER_NAME} --resource-group ${ARO_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME} --query consoleProfile.url --output tsv
```
